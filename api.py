### Task
Generate a SQL query to answer the following question:
`{prompt}`

### Database Schema
This query will run on a database whose schema is represented in this string:
CREATE TABLE products (
  product_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, -- Unique ID for each product
  name VARCHAR(50), -- Name of the product
  price DECIMAL(10,2), -- Price of each unit of the product
  quantity INTEGER  -- Current quantity in stock
);

CREATE TABLE sales (
  sale_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, -- Unique ID for each sale
  product_id INTEGER, -- ID of product sold
  customer_id INTEGER,  -- ID of customer who made purchase
  salesperson_id INTEGER, -- ID of salesperson who made the sale
  sale_date DATE, -- Date the sale occurred
  quantity INTEGER -- Quantity of product sold
);

-- sales.product_id can be joined with products.product_id

### Examples
The following are examples to help illustrate the desired user response.

Prompt: What are the product names?
SQL: SELECT name FROM products;
          
Prompt: When did ID=20 make a purchase?
SQL: SELECT salesperson_id, sale_date FROM products WHERE salesperson_id=20;

Prompt: Please remove the entry for customer ID=35
SQL:

Prompt: Please add an item to the table
SQL:

--The database is read only, so we don't generate output that may modify the table. 

### SQL
Given the database schema, here is the SQL query that answers `{prompt}`. Do not provide explanation and only provide SQL code. Do not produce commands that modify the table:
```sql
[/INST]
  """,
})

print(output[0]['generated_text'])
